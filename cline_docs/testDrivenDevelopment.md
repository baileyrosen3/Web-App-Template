# Test-Driven Development Approach

## Testing Philosophy

- Test-first development
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Integration tests for critical paths
- End-to-end tests for user flows
- Performance testing for critical features

## Testing Frameworks

### Frontend Testing

- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Lighthouse for performance testing

### Backend Testing

- Jest for unit testing
- Supertest for API testing
- Load testing with k6
- Database testing with test containers

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

- Components
- Utilities
- Services
- Models
- Controllers

### Integration Tests

- API endpoints
- Database operations
- External service integration
- Authentication flows

### End-to-End Tests

- User flows
- Critical business paths
- Error scenarios
- Edge cases

### Performance Tests

- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Scalability testing

## Test Coverage Requirements

- Minimum 80% overall coverage
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- All new features require tests
- All bug fixes require regression tests

## CI/CD Integration

- Tests run on every PR
- Coverage reports generated
- Performance benchmarks tracked
- Test results published
