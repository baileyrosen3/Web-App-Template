# Test Driven Development

## Testing Framework
1. Frontend Testing:
   - Jest for unit testing
   - React Testing Library for component testing
   - Cypress for end-to-end testing
   - TypeScript integration for type-safe tests

2. Backend Testing:
   - Jest for unit testing
   - Supertest for API testing
   - Database testing with test environment
   - Mock service workers for external APIs

## Test Cases
1. Frontend Test Cases:
   - Component rendering
   - User interactions
   - State management
   - API integration
   - Responsive design

2. Backend Test Cases:
   - API endpoints
   - Database operations
   - Authentication flows
   - Error handling
   - Data validation

## TDD Approach
1. Development Cycle:
   - Write failing test
   - Implement feature
   - Pass test
   - Refactor
   - Repeat

2. Testing Guidelines:
   - Test business logic thoroughly
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Use meaningful test descriptions
   - Maintain test isolation
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Testing

   - Component testing with React Testing Library
   - Utility function testing with Jest
   - Type checking with TypeScript
   - Snapshot testing for UI components

2. Integration Testing

   - API route testing
   - Page navigation testing
   - State management testing
   - Form submission flows

3. End-to-End Testing
   - User flow testing with Cypress
   - Critical path testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Mobile responsiveness

## Testing Frameworks

1. Jest

   - Default testing framework
   - Snapshot testing
   - Mocking capabilities
   - Code coverage reporting

2. React Testing Library

   - Component testing
   - User interaction testing
   - Accessibility testing
   - DOM queries and assertions

3. Cypress (Future Implementation)
   - End-to-end testing
   - Visual regression testing
   - Network request stubbing
   - Time travel debugging

## Test Cases

1. Component Tests

   - Render testing
   - Props validation
   - Event handling
   - State changes
   - Error boundaries

2. Page Tests

   - Route handling
   - Data fetching
   - SEO elements
   - Loading states
   - Error states

3. Utility Tests
   - Helper functions
   - Data transformations
   - API utilities
   - Type validations

## Testing Best Practices

1. Test Organization

   - One test file per component/utility
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Proper test isolation
   - Meaningful assertions

2. Testing Patterns

   - Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
   - Don't test implementation details
   - Test user behavior
   - Mock external dependencies

3. Code Coverage
   - Maintain high coverage
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Balance coverage with value
   - Regular coverage reports

## CI/CD Integration

1. Automated Testing

   - Run tests on pull requests
   - Block merges on test failures
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Performance benchmarking

2. Testing Environment
   - Consistent test environment
   - Proper test data
   - Environment variables
   - Cache management
