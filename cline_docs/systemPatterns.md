# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

- Monorepo structure with separate frontend and backend
- Clean architecture principles
- Domain-driven design
- RESTful API design
- Microservices-ready structure

## Key Technical Decisions

1. Monorepo Structure
   - Easier dependency management
   - Shared types and utilities
   - Consistent tooling
2. TypeScript First

   - Type safety across full stack
   - Better developer experience
   - Reduced runtime errors

3. Next.js for Frontend

   - Server-side rendering capabilities
   - API routes support
   - Excellent developer experience
   - Built-in routing and optimization

4. Express.js for Backend

   - Proven and stable
   - Great middleware ecosystem
   - Easy to scale
   - TypeScript support

5. Prisma as ORM

   - Type-safe database queries
   - Excellent migration system
   - Auto-generated types
   - Great developer experience

6. Containerized Development
   - Consistent development environment
   - Easy local setup
   - Production-like environment

## Architectural Patterns

1. Repository Pattern for Data Access
2. Service Layer Pattern
3. Dependency Injection
4. Event-Driven Architecture Ready
5. CQRS Ready
6. Feature-Based Structure
7. Atomic Design for Components
